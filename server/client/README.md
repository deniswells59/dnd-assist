# Express Authentication Boilerplate React Client
This is a simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that works with the [Express Authentication Boilerplate](https://github.com/JamesIves/express-authentication-boilerplate). This application will provide a user with the option to either signup or signin using a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) provided by the server. You're also able to visit `/private` to get a piece of data that requires client authentication to view.

## Installation
This application can be installed via npm by running `npm install`. Once installed you're able to launch the application in a local server by running `npm start`. You'll also need to have your [Express server running](https://github.com/JamesIves/express-authentication-boilerplate) before you'll be able to make a POST or GET request to the server.
